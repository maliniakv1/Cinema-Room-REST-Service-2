# Cinema Room REST Service

As part of the Jetbrains Academy - "Java Backend Developer" course I'm making a REST service allowing for managing a cinema. This application will allow for showing available seats, selling and refunding tickets, and showing statistics.

For now this application returns inforamtion about seats possible to buy using a `GET /seats` request.
